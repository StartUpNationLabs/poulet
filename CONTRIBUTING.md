## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/fr/get-started/using-github/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/fr/get-started/using-github/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

As for the commit, we use the [Conventionnal commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention.
